#+todo: SPIKE(s) INCUBATING(i) | STABLE(t) PUBLISHED(p)

This is a repository for Emacs Lisp packages that I think could be useful for
friends and coworkers. It's an experimental, low-pressure space for me just to
hack on Lisp with the garage door open.

If something reaches a stable state I may publish it if there's interest.

* Curiosities On Show
This repository contains a mix of end-user libraries and supporting libraries.
The interesting stuff is listed below.

** INCUBATING [[file:lisp/org-roam-review.el][org-roam-review]] /(incubating)/
Implements a system for managing [[https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens][Evergreen Notes]] on top of org-roam. Provides a
spaced-repetition system that prompts you to review notes or revisit stubs and
help them grow to maturity.

** INCUBATING [[file:lisp/org-roam-dblocks.el][org-roam-dblocks]] /(incubating)/
Add org dynamic blocks that implement "canned searches" for org-roam. You can
search for notes or list backlinks, then do additional filtering based on title
or tags.

** INCUBATING [[file:lisp/org-roam-search.el][org-roam-search]] /(incubating)/
Search your org-roam files for a string and display a buffer of results. Results
are shown with collapsible previews, like in the org-roam buffer.

** INCUBATING [[file:lisp/org-roam-links.el][org-roam-links]] /(incubating)/
Display a tree of backlinks /and/ forward links up to a configurable depth. Useful
for looking for unexpected connections without busting open a full-fledged graph
UI. Contrasts with the normal org-roam buffer, which only shows backlinks.

** INCUBATING [[file:lisp/org-roam-consult.el][org-roam-consult]] /(incubating)/
A version of =consult-ripgrep= that shows node titles instead of filenames so you
don't have to guess anymore.

** SPIKE [[file:lisp/org-roam-gc.el][org-roam-gc]] /(spike)/
Automatically delete empty dailies files so they don't build up forever.

** SPIKE [[file:lisp/org-roam-rewrite.el][org-roam-rewrite]] /(spike)/
Commands for renaming nodes, rewriting links and deleting nodes with redirection
so you can refactor notes without leaving broken links.

** SPIKE [[file:lisp/timekeep.el][timekeep]] /(spike)/
Provides a structured way to use org-roam for representing multiple
clients/employers. It provides a simple clocking interface built on org-clock
and provides integrations with org-capture.

** SPIKE [[file:lisp/org-roam-refill-previews.el][org-roam-refill-previews]] /(spike)/
Refill previews in the backlinks buffer so they fit the window.

* Installation
Most packages should be manually installable via =package.el=, assuming you have
[[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]] set up. But honestly, you're better off just cloning this repo and putting
its lisp directory in your load path, then installing anything missing. ðŸ¤·

- Clone the repo:
  #+begin_src sh
    $ git clone git@github.com:chrisbarrett/nursery.git <path>
  #+end_src

- Add to load path:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "<path>/lisp")
  #+end_src

- load desired features in your =~/.config/emacs/init.el=, e.g.:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
